## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is the first project out of four projects carried out as a part of the Data Science Nano Degree program. For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb from Jan 2016 - Jan 2017 Data to better understand:

1.	What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
2.	Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?
3.	What is the most populate Seattle neighborhood for Airbnb listings?
4.	Can we predict a price of Seattle Airbnb listings? What aspects correlate well to price?

Seattle Airbnb Open Data is available in kaggle. [link](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/home)

## File Descriptions 

There are 4 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional .py file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict the Seattle listings price.
 
## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@aliah.ghannam/airbnb-seattle-homes-fa73adb2a477)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).  feel free to use the code here as you would like!
